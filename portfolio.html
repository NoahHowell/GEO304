            <p>The visit to Grenfell Tower is a strong reminder of the socioenvironmental inequalities that are linked to globalization. The roots of the 2017 fire that killed 72 residents can be traced back to systemic failures, many of which are tied to global economic and political dynamics. The highly flammable cladding used to cut costs, speaks volumes about the neoliberal policies that dominate global markets, where profit is considered above safety. The tragedy also underlines how marginalized communities, often comprising of immigrants and low-income residents, bear the brunt of environmental and infrastructural neglect. Grenfell Tower has since become a symbol of social injustice, galvanizing movements for housing reform and corporate accountability. The tragedy in this local area sparked international debate on urban safety standards, ethical governance, and the serious human impact of cost-cutting policies.
                The days and weeks following the fire have revealed the gross inequalities in disaster response and resource allocation. Survivors have been offered little support, with many homeless or transferred to temporary housing for years. It is a stark reminder that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are commonly overlooked during crises, a pattern repeated in many natural and man-made disasters around the world. The tragedy of Grenfell has also brought out the weaknesses in the building regulatory environment, placing fire safety and corporate practices under international scrutiny. As urbanization in most parts of the world accelerates, the message of Grenfell speaks volumes beyond London, emphasizing the critical need for robust and inclusive safety measures.
                Additionally, the Grenfell fire brought into the open power dynamics between residents and those in government. The voices of the residents of Grenfell, who had complained before about the safety of the building, were ignored, which is reflective of systemic marginalization. This negligence toward local knowledge and community advocacy is a recurring situation with most global development projects, wherein the top-down approach completely fails to recognize the needs of those whom it should serve.
                Grenfell underscores how local events are never truly isolated from broader global systems. The tower reveals the lasting impacts of capitalism and systemic neglect, reminding us that understanding global socioenvironmental systems requires attention to local contexts. This visit highlighted the need for equitable systems that address historical injustices while prioritizing human dignity and safety in a globalized world. By examining Grenfell, we see the interconnectedness of local and global forces and the urgent need for systemic change to prevent future tragedies.

            <h2>Green Careers</h2>
            <p>The visit to Gravesend, where Pocahontas is buried, acts as a powerful lens to delve deep into the interaction of livelihood with global systems. The story of Pocahontas' life and legacy underscores how colonialism shaped the very course of her life, coupled with the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples and settlers. Her journey from North America to England represents the economic motives of European expansion, where the extraction of resources and labor often came at the expense of Indigenous autonomy and well-being.
                At Gravesend, Pocahontas' burial site serves as a reminder of how colonial narratives romanticized figures like her to justify broader economic and imperial pursuits. Pocahontas, through historical accounts, was cast in front of English society as a token representing the "civilized savage" to help further the colonial agenda and justify the Native peoples' exploitation. Here, this localization of an international story underscores how human individuals, either by their choice or through force, came to be ensnared within networks of trade, agriculture, and cultural exchange. For Pocahontas, this meant becoming a symbol of peace and assimilation, even as her own community faced displacement and hardship. Her life encapsulates the economic and social pressures of the time, where livelihoods were profoundly shaped by the colonial agenda.
                Additionally, the environmental aspect of Gravesend's story is a dimension that cannot be ignored. Colonial expansion not only involved the control of people, but also natural resource exploitation. This relentless pursuit of wealth led to deforestation, disruption of ecosystems, and unsustainable agricultural practices that still have repercussions today. In the present global environmental challenges, it is time for us to reflect on how historical patterns of exploitation inform current approaches toward resource management and sustainability. The visit to Gravesend has reinforced an understanding that technologies and systems under development must respect human dignity and prioritize environmental stewardship to make sure progress does not come at a cost to the planet. Pocahontas' story prompts reflection on how technology can, much like colonial expansion, primarily serve the interests of dominant groups while exploiting others. Technological advancement can bridge divides and create opportunities, yet simultaneously runs the risk of entrenching inequalities if it is not implemented with thought. I will continue to be conscious, in my professional life, of how such progress affects livelihoods, especially in already marginalized communities. With automation and artificial intelligence already changing the face of industries, there is an increasing need to make sure opportunities and resources are equitably available.
                Gravesend's historical context underlines the importance of inclusive systems that put human dignity and sustainability first. Whether in historical or modern contexts, livelihoods are often at the mercy of larger, interconnected forces. This visit has given me a deeper understanding of the need to approach my future work with a sense of responsibility and a commitment to fostering equitable outcomes. Learning from the past, I hope to contribute to systems that uplift and do not marginalize, with technology serving as a tool of empowerment rather than exploitation.
