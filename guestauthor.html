            <h2>Group Solutions</h2>
            <p>The visit to the Museum of Science in London sparked a lively and thought-provoking discussion among our group about the complex interplay between innovation, sustainability, and greenwashing. Walking through exhibits that displayed transformative industrial technologies that reshaped our relationship with the earth and going to the exhibit aimed at addressing environmental challenges, we found ourselves questioning the motivations behind these innovations and their actual impact. While some members of our group were inspired by the displays, viewing them as evidence of human ingenuity and progress toward a greener future, others expressed skepticism, pointing out the ways corporations often co-opt the language of sustainability to obscure harmful practices. These differing perspectives highlighted the importance of critically engaging with narratives about green innovation and examining whose interests they ultimately serve. 
                One of the most striking moments was our discussion about a display featuring a major energy corporation’s investment in renewable technologies. Some of us saw this as a positive step, arguing that even partial investment in green energy reflects progress in the right direction. Others, however, viewed it as a textbook example of greenwashing, where companies leverage small-scale sustainable projects to deflect attention from their broader contributions to environmental degradation. This divergence of opinions brought to light the necessity of context and transparency when evaluating environmental initiatives, reminding us that no solution exists in isolation from the systems that enable it. 
                Despite these differing viewpoints, a shared theme emerged: the need for more holistic solutions that go beyond surface-level fixes. As a group, we agreed that addressing climate change requires both technological innovation and systemic change, including rethinking economic and political structures that prioritize profit over sustainability. This synergy of ideas underscored the value of intercultural and interdisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives—each shaped by our individual experiences and areas of study—we were able to approach the issue from multiple angles, enriching our understanding of the complexities involved. 
                The visit reinforced the importance of dialogue and critical thinking when navigating the overlapping worlds of science, sustainability, and corporate interests. It also reminded me of the value of working alongside others who challenge my assumptions and broaden my perspective. Collaboration is not always about agreement but about creating space for divergent views to coexist and inform one another. In tackling global issues like greenwashing, these intercultural competencies are not just useful—they are essential for developing nuanced and effective solutions.
